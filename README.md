## Brunnhilde - A companion to Seigfried  

Generates aggregate reports of files in a directory or disk image based on input from Richard Lehane's [Siegfried](http://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried).  

Brunnhilde runs Siegfried against a specified directory or disk image, loads the results into a sqlite3 database, and queries the database to generate reports to aid in triage, arrangement, and description of digital archives. The program will check for viruses unless specified otherwise. Outputs include:  

* A folder of CSV reports on file formats and versions, mimetypes, last modified dates, unidentified files, Siegfried warnings and errors, and duplicate files (by md5 hash)  
* An HTML report which includes some provenance information on the scan itself, aggregate statistics for the material as a whole (number of files, begin and end dates, number of unique vs. duplicate files, etc.), and all non-blank CSV reports printed as HTML tables
* A tree report of the directory structure  
* The full Siegfried CSV output  
* Timestamped log of ClamScan virus check
* Optional Bulk Extractor output

All outputs are placed into a new directory named after the filename passed to Brunnhilde as the last argument.  

For the most accurate statistics with Siegfried 1.6+, it is advised to force Siegfried to make single identifications for files with multiple filetypes. This can be accomplished with roy using the following command:  

```
roy build -multi 0
```  

For a more detailed explanation of how multiple identifications are handled by Siegfried, see [https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/75](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/issues/75).  

### Running Brunnhilde  

usage: brunnhilde.py [-h] [-b] [-d] [--hfs] [-n] [-r] source filename  

positional arguments:  
  source : Path to source directory or disk image  
  filename : Name of csv file to create  

optional arguments:
	-h, --help : show this help message and exit
	
	-b, --bulkextractor: Run Bulk Extractor on source
	
	-d, --diskimage : Use disk image instead of dir as input
	
	--hfs : Use for raw disk images of HFS disks
	
	-n, --noclam: Skip ClamScan Virus Check
	
	-r, --removefiles : Delete 'carved_files' directory when done  
  
For file paths containing spaces in directory names, enclose the entire path in '' or "" quotes.  

### Using disk images as input  

In -d mode, Brunnhilde uses SleuthKit's tsk_recover to export files from a disk image into a "carved files" directory for analysis. This works with raw (dd) images by default. In Bitcurator or any other environment where libewf has been compiled into SleuthKit, Brunnhilde's -d mode also supports forensic disk image formats, including aff and ewf (E01). Due to the limitations of SleuthKit, Brunnhilde does not yet support characterizing disks that use the UDF filesystem.  

To characterize HFS formatted disks, use both the "-d" and "--hfs" flags, and be sure to use a raw disk image as the source (HFSExplorer is unable to process forensically packaged disk images). This functionality works best in Bitcurator. Non-Bitcurator environments will require you to install additional dependencies (HFSExplorer and Java) and to configure some Brunnhilde settings, such as the path to the "unhfs.sh" script and potentially the options being passed to it.  

By default, Brunnhilde will keep a copy of the files exported from disk images in a "carved_files" directory. If you do not wish to keep a copy of these files after reporting is finished, you can pass the "-r" or "--removefiles" flag to have Brunnhilde delete the directory when it is finished.  

### Dependencies  

#### General  
* Python 2.7
* [Siegfried](http://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried): Brunnhilde is now compatible with all version of Siegfried, including 1.6.1. It does not yet have support for MIME-Info or FDD signatures: for Brunnhilde to work, Siegfried must be using the PRONOM signature file only. If you have been using MIME-Info or FDD signatures as a replacement for or alongside PRONOM with Siegfried 1.5/1.6 on your machine, entering "roy build" in the terminal should return you to Siegfried's default PRONOM-only identification mode and allow Brunnhilde to work properly.  
* tree: Installed by default in most Linux distros. On OS X, install using [Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/tree). If tree is not installed on your machine, a blank tree.txt file will be created instead. 
* [Bulk Extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor): Can be built on Linux and OS X from source distribution found [here](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor) or installed using [Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/tree). 
* [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net): Brunnhilde checks for viruses using ClamAV, which can be built from the source distribution found at clamav.net or using [Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/tree). 

#### To process disk images  
* [SleuthKit](http://www.sleuthkit.org/): Installed by default in Bitcurator. On OS X, can be installed using Homebrew with "brew install sleuthkit".
* [HFSExplorer](http://www.catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/): Installed by default in Bitcurator. Brunnhilde uses unhfs, the included command-line implementation of HFSExplorer.  

### Future development to-dos

* Add ability to use MIME-Info signature files (alone or alongside PRONOM) with Siegfried 1.5+  
* Add ability to use FDD signature files (alone or alongside PRONOM) with Siegfried 1.6+  
* Add support for UDF disk images  
* More and better testing  
* Move from raw SQL to ORM?
